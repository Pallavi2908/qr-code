## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

* I learned how to use flexbox in centering divs
* Resetting the stylesheet provided by browser for smoother personal styling.


### Continued development

- In my future solution,I want to get more comfortable with using flexbox.
- I was confused with positioning of divs during the course of this project,and hence would like to work on my basic understanding of CSS.
